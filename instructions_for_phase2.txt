We're building a student management system with different dashboards for admins and students. We've already completed Phase 1, which involved creating database views and functions to support these dashboards:

- Created student_practice_stats, student_recent_activity, student_fee_status views
- Created practice_sessions_today, practice_sessions_week, practice_sessions_month views
- Created student_unread_messages view
- Created update_fee_paid_until, get_student_practice_stats, get_student_fee_status functions

Current Status
- The existing dashboard at src/app/page.tsx will remain as the admin dashboard
- We need to create a new student dashboard and implement role-based routing

Phase 2 Implementation Tasks

1. Create Student Dashboard Page
- Create a new file at src/app/student-dashboard/page.tsx
- Design student dashboard with these components:
  - Practice Sessions stat card
  - Practice Time stat card
  - Unread Messages card
  - Practice Materials card
  - Student-specific Recent Activity section
  - Fee alerts should stay, just only be able to see the fee alerts for them self, so like if there fee is paid or not like it should basically show the red yello green month, whatever the admin changes it to basically.

2. Create Required Data Service Functions
- Update src/lib/data-service.ts to add:
  - getStudentPracticeSessions(studentId, period)
  - getStudentPracticeStats(studentId, period)
  - getStudentUnreadMessages(studentId)
  - getStudentFeeStatus(studentId)

3. Implement Role-Based Routing
- Update src/middleware.ts to check user role and redirect accordingly
- Keep existing logic for auth checks
- Add role-based redirect logic:
  - If user role is 'admin', they should see /
  - If user role is 'student', they should see /student-dashboard

Design & Technical Guidelines
- Use ShadCN UI for all components to maintain consistent styling
- Feel free to install additional ShadCN UI components if needed
- Student dashboard layout should be exactly the same to admin dashboard for consistency
- Use the existing DashboardLayout component but with appropriate role checks
- Maintain color scheme and component styling consistent with admin dashboard

Implementation Details
For the student dashboard:
1. Practice Sessions card should show count with appropriate icon
2. Practice Time card should show total hours and minutes with appropriate icon
3. Fee Status should use color coding (red for past month, yellow for current month, green for future months)
4. Recent Activity should only show the student's own activities
5. Practice Sessions and Practice Time cards should be clickable, leading to detailed views

Please maintain the exact UI styling from the current dashboard, just adapt the content for student-specific data.
